Spring XD is a unified, distributed, and extensible system for data ingestion, real time analytics, batch processing, and data export. The project's goal is to simplify the development of big data applications.

<h2 id="toc_0">Benefits</h2>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 0">
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Unified Platform</h3>
		<p>Spring XD is a unified platform for a fragmented Hadoop ecosystem.  It&rsquo;s built on top of battle-tested open source projects, and  dramatically simplifies orchestration of Big Data workloads and data pipelines.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Open and Extensible</h3>
		<p>Spring XD is built to be adapted from the ground up to suit your enterprise&rsquo;s unique needs, not dictate your technology choices for you.  Extend in any direction with open plug-in points for your existing technology investments, implemented with simple Java classes.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Developer Productivity</h3>
		<p>Developers new to Big Data can use a no-coding, configuration driven tool to develop Spring XD applications. Java developers can also easily extend the platform or the DSL with familiar extensibility, testing, and automation tools inherited directly from <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/">Spring Batch</a> &amp; <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/">Integration</a>.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<img class="styled-image" src="img/spring-xd-unified-platform-for-big-data.png" alt="The unified platform for big data" title="The unified platform for big data"/>
<h2 id="toc_1">Features</h2>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 0">
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Data from anywhere, to anywhere</h3>
		<p>Data-driven apps require refined and consolidated data at scale. Spring XD&rsquo;s stream and batch workflow lets you build pipelines to consume data from various endpoints and consolidate them in Hadoop, in-memory data grids such as <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="http://pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire">GemFire</a>, and virtually any data store.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Rock-solid distributed runtime</h3>
		<p>Spring XD provides PMML model scoring to compute predictions in real-time. Apache Spark Streaming is an out-of-the-box processor module in Spring XD, and can be plugged in to perform online machine learning with the help of MLLib algorithms.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Deep Analytics</h3>
		<p>Developers new to Big Data can use a no-coding, configuration driven tool to develop Spring XD applications. Java developers can also easily extend the platform or the DSL with familiar extensibility, testing, and automation tools inherited directly from Spring Batch &amp; Integration.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row" style="margin-left: 0">
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Developer Friendly</h3>
		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to integrate data with Hadoop and any data store - like Greenplum Database, HAWQ or GemFire.  No coding is required to use the DSL (Domain Specific Language) and interacting with the server is done via REST, in any programming language.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Monitoring and Management</h3>
		<p>Remote monitoring and management of the runtime components are supported via JMX endpoints. A built-in Admin UI allows visualization and remote management of containers in the distributed setup.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Portable and Extensible Runtime</h3>
		<p>Spring XD runs anywhere Java does - on-prem, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, YARN, EC2, Mesos, Docker, etc. A plug-in based architecture allows Java/Hadoop experts to extend the runtime components, allowing DSL (Domain Specific Language) users to leverage the extensions immediately.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
<h2 id="toc_0">Use-Cases</h2>

<div class="row" style="margin-left: 0">
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Closed-loop Analytics</h3>
		<p>Spring XD orchestrates the entire analytics loop - gathering data from any source, triggering actions, handling feedback loops from machine learning models, and computing real-time predictions.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Internet of Things</h3>
		<p>Enable predictive analytics in-real time over large amounts of machine data, driving business and operation improvements in real-time. Spring XD&rsquo;s data-integration adapters connect with various data-producing devices, and can be extended to meet any unique device or protocol.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row" style="margin-left: 0">
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Batch Workflow Orchestration</h3>
		<p>Traditional enterprise “Big Data” was often done with batch processing.  Get productive by using out-of-the-box jobs as templates - avoiding  the need to write code.  The infrastructure, environment specifics and automation is handled by Spring XD, allowing the enterprise to solely focus on business logic.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Complex Event Processing</h3>
		<p>Spring XD provides integration with Project Reactor Streams, RxJava Observables, and Spark Streaming. Creating a data stream processor in XD allows you to use a functional programming model to filter, transform and aggregate data in a very concise and performant way. By working with events as you would with collections, Spring XD&rsquo;s reactive-stream integration allows you to build complex event processors to respond to events in real-time.</p>

## Quick Start

To get started, make sure your system has as a minimum Java JDK 7 or newer
installed:

```
$ java -version
```
Download
[spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE.zip](http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/xd/spring-xd/1.1.0.RELEASE/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE-dist.zip)
and unzip the distribution:

```
$ jar xvf ./spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE-dist.zip
```

Set the environment variable **XD_HOME** to `xd` within the installation directory:

```
$ export XD_HOME="`pwd`/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd"
```
Change into the installation directory:

```
$ cd spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE
```
Start the Spring XD single-node runtime:

```
$ ./xd/bin/xd-singlenode
```
In another console, start the Spring XD Shell and create your first stream
within the shell:

```
$ ./shell/bin/xd-shell
xd:> stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock --deploy
```
